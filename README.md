# Spring 2018 Workshops

Welcome to the repository of the project for our Spring 2018 workshop series!

## What is this?

This is the project you create through our series of workshops covering...

1. Web Servers
2. APIs
3. Front End Frameworks
4. Continuous Integration & Deployment

## How can I get started?

### Using Glitch

During the workshops, we use glitch. Our working copy is at [glitch.com/edit/#!/hs-2018s-workshops](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/hs-2018s-workshops). Alternatively, you can run your own copy by 'remixing' it! ([What's remixing???](https://glitch.com/faq#remix))

[![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/import/github/HackSheffield/workshops-2018)

### On your own machine

If you'd prefer to run it on your own machine, that's easy - only a few prerequisites.

To get started:

- [Install Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Run `npm install` to install our dependencies!
- Run `npm start` to start our application!
- Go to http://localhost:3000 to see it.
